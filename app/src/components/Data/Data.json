                "Operation H.O.M.E. (\"Heck Off My Earth\") is a simple arcade shooter created for the 2019 Global Game Jam. The theme of 2019 was \"home\" and what it means to you. Does home mean a sound, smell, feeling, or location? My team decided that for us it meant defending the Earth from invading aliens.",
                "My team used the Unity engine and I used Ableton Live 10 to design sounds. I oversaw mainly audio implementation via C# scripting to ensure that sounds were triggering as desired as well as sound design. Things you'll hear include the UI/UX, a laser gun, and an arcade-y space atmosphere. If I wasn't working on sound, I was writing scripts for enemy spawning behavior and camera shake."

                "Distortion can be created quite simply by multiplying a signal by a real number. Using itself as that multiplier can sometimes results in pretty rough distortion, but can be adaptable for just about anything with the right mix adjustments. The gain, drive, and mix settings allow for a bit more meticulous control of the sounds.",
                "This plugin was created using the JUCE framework by ROLI, which operates in C++. Audio programming is something that I think is incredibly interesting and refreshing to do especially since it's using C++. It's kind of like my hobby within programming."
