The purpose of the class is to gain a perspective of how video game systems shape an entire game's basis of gameplay through building an implementation.",
                "Although it was quite fun designing the systems behind this game, I found my enjoyment in creating their implementations. They turned out to be quite interesting and technical, most notably the grid-based pathfinding system that calculates movement costs based on the tile's type (i.e. water, grass, forest, or mountain) and a unit's state (i.e. water, fire, or grass).

Does home mean a location, sound, smell, or feeling? My team decided that for us it meant defending the Earth from invading aliens.",
                "I used Ableton Live 10 to design the sounds and handled their implementation into the acutal game with C# scripts. Although audio was my core responsibility, I also wrote scripts for core gameplay mechanics including player movement and enemy movement and spawning behavior."

                "Because my main project for the jam was Operation H.O.M.E., I was only able to dedicate enough time to design the sounds for Cozy Cat Cafe. I quite enjoyed this process simply because the game already had such a cute vibe even without the sounds. Once the bubbly UI clicks and various kitchen sounds were added, the game felt even more cohesive and complete."

I find ring modulation to be a perfect technique to explore this type of sound palette, so learning the DSP mathematics and implementation for ring modulation was an extremely entertaining process."
