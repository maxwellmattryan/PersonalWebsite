Instructions for Coding Section:

The coding questions in this exam deal with a TV database. The schema for this database is given below. 

Actor (aid, fname, lname, gender, dob)

Show (sid, name, description, release_date, rent_price, cid)

Channel (cid, name, region)

Cast (aid, sid, role)

 

A tuple in the Cast relation represents that a person from the Actor relation starred in a Show with a specific role. There can be multiple Cast rows with the same aid (e.g. if Matthew Rhys stars in two shows, there would be two rows with the same aid, but a different sid). 

 

Actor.aid, Show.sid, Channel.cid == primary keys of the corresponding tables

Cast.aid and Cast.sid == primary key of Cast 

Show.cid == foreign key to Channel.cid 

Cast.aid == foreign key to Actor.aid

Cast.sid == foreign key to Show.sid
