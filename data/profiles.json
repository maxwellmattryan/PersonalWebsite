Because of that, game development and its creative process often feels quite exciting, fresh, and invigorating for me. If the project and team environment permits, I like to couple these skills with my background in music and sound to creative dynamic and immersive sounds for the game, each of which is precisely implemented using scripts and middleware (if necessary).",
