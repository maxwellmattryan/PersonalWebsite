Bloom is a multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet application that is intended to be your
all-in-one Web3 command center.

It is feature-laden with mechanisms and tools to interact with various dApps
and smart contracts from within the web browser, transfer tokens and NFTs 
(including ERC20 and ERC721 assets), vote on governance proposals, and buy
tokens with fiat directly in-app.

You can see their beautiful [website](https://bloomwallet.io){:target="_blank"} for more

dive into the source code.

Cheers!
